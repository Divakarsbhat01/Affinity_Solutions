# ***  Assumptions made in the programe    ***
# the input file given to me is an text file with an extension .txt
# mildly profane words: idiot, stupid, donkey
# medium profane words: shrewd, cunning, demagouge
# harsh profane words: monkey, rat
# filename is myfile.txt its the file in which the collection of twitter comments are located
# the input file(myfile.txt) is placed in the same folder where the script/ code file is placed

# *** Logic Explaination ***
# first open the file in read mode
# copy all the contents into a list (it automatically gets seperated by line)
# remove all the '\n' characters
# convert list to string
# split the string at '.'(full stop) as problem constraint states that analysis will be done based on sentences
# define what is mild, medium and harshly profane use dictionary with clearly defined words, their scores along with category
# extract a sentence from a list
# check for harsh, meduium and mildly profane words, once a category is discovered...
#stop checking further and assign it to profanity value(prof in this program)
#print the sentence with level of profanity in that language
